<p>It is a very sad song, which i can relate to hauntingly so. When he died, drive was played in his honor at a memorial service at the rock and roll hall of fame. I enjoyed listening to this song as a teenager, but i never would have imagined that well into my 30�s it would hold so much meaning. If you weren�t aware, drive was originally a song by the band the cars, from 1984. Have you ever wondered what the dashboard symbols mean? To.</p>

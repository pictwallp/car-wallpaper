<p>The fuel that an electric car runs on is electricity (which is used to charge the batteries) and the fuel that a hydrogen fuel cell car runs on is hydrogen (which is used to generate electricity). Each fuel cell contains oxygen and hydrogen, and it can produce power for an indefinite amount of time. Hydrogen cars run by transport for london (tfl) are used significantly more than equivalent petrol and diesel models, new research has revealed. Both electric and hydrogen cars lack internal combustion engines and run on electricity instead of petrol or diesel.</p>

Toyota is aiming at building 30,000 hydrogen fuel cell cars by 2020.”. The performance, availability of refueling stations and price will definitely have to go the electric car’s way.

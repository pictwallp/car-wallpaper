<p><strong>When Were Cars Invented In Japan</strong>, American car manufacturers had begun building cars in japan for the japanese market and were, by 1930, producing nearly 20,000 units per year. Although japan dominated car production until recently, chinese firms now make more cars than any other country (almost 25 million).
